            The Challenge We Address
          </h2>

          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed max-w-4xl">
            Accessing basic healthcare information is often more difficult than it
            should be. Blood donation camps frequently go unnoticed, clinics and health
            camps operate without centralized visibility, and emergency contact numbers
            are not always available when time is critical.
          </p>

          <p className="mt-5 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed max-w-4xl">
            For elderly individuals and people managing long-term health conditions,
            remembering daily medications becomes an additional challenge. These gaps
            in access and organization can lead to missed care opportunities, delayed
            responses, and unnecessary stress during already difficult situations.

            Carelink addresses these challenges by serving as a single, reliable point
            of access for community healthcare needs. Instead of navigating multiple

            and structured health resources in one place.
          </p>

          <p className="mt-5 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed max-w-4xl">
            The platform allows users to discover nearby blood donation camps, manage
            their medications through a simple tracking system, view clinics and health
            camps with available appointment slots, and access emergency services
            instantly — all without overwhelming the user.
